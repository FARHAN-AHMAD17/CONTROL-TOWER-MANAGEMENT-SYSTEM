3. Click on the Tools, present in the upper menu, option number 10.
4. In the Tools Option, click on the Nu Get package Manager, and open the package manager console.
5. In the console, paste this command  **Install-Package System.Text.Json**. Press Enter.
6. Do the same in the Client side(FLIGHT.sln).

**INTRODUCTION**
As air traffic continues to grow, ensuring the safety and efficiency of landings and
takeoffs becomes increasingly critical. Traditional air traffic control methods rely
heavily on the expertise of human controllers, but with the rise of parallel and
distributed computing (P&DC), new possibilities emerge. This project proposes the
development of a novel flight tower management system that leverages P&DC
techniques to optimize job sequencing for aircraft. By employing parallel
processing for real-time data analysis and distributed computing for
comprehensive traffic monitoring, the system aims to generate optimal landing and
takeoff sequences that minimize delays, prioritize safety, and maximize airspace
capacity. This project has the potential to revolutionize air traffic management by
harnessing the power of P&DC to create a more efficient and secure airspace for
all.
